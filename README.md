##Branches

  (shouldn't be more than ~40 characters)

Branch name formatting should be as follows:
- If there is a relevant, single Issue that the branch will completely solve:  
  `devname`/`issuenumber`/`short-description`  
  _e.g._ `logan/21-pull-out-base-class-functionality`

- If the branch wraps up multiple Issues or has no associated Issue:  
  `devname`/`short-description`  
  _e.g._ `logan/readme-updates`

##Pull Requests
- If a PR directly closes one or more issues, those issues should be listed in
the description with one of the auto-closing prefixes as described
[here](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).  
  _e.g._ "Closes #15: Refactored constants into a package with top-level classes."
